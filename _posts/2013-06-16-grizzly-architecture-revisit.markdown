Back in April, I gave a presentation in Portland at the OpenStack Summit on the architecture of OpenStack Grizzly. As the presentation was limited to 45 minutes, I said I would post a more in-depth article about it (similar to my last Folsom OpenStack Archtecture post) shortly. 

Unfortunately, [work got in the way](http://www.solinea.com/).

I have finally made good on my promise and posted the full in-depth article along with several clarifications over on my work blog at [http://www.solinea.com/2013/06/15/openstack-grizzly-architecture-revisited/](http://www.solinea.com/2013/06/15/openstack-grizzly-architecture-revisited/).

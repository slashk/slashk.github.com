It's been an interesting project, as cloud computing is both very new, but based on some very old concepts.</p>
<p>On Monday, we will be presenting our work in progress at <a href="http://developers.sun.com/events/communityone/2009/west/index.jsp">CommunityOne West</a> in San Francisco's Moscone Center. Around the same time, we hope to move our work into the public view on <a href="http://wikis.sun.com/display/cloud/Patterns">wikis.sun.com</a> for comments and contributions. I'll post something here as soon as it happens.</p>
<p>Our talk will highlight three sets of pattern domains: provisioning, monitoring and resource administration. You can expect to hear talk of motivations and implementations, with sequence diagrams, architecture pictures and code snippets for illustration.</p>

We are "<strong>2:40 - 3:30 pm | Practical Cloud Computing Patterns (Gateway 104)</strong>" under the Cloud Platforms topic.</p>

<p>I had a great opportunity to revisit China, part of my old region (and now part of my new global responsibility), as part of The Open Group's kickoff last week:</p>
<blockquote><a href="http://www.opengroup.org/">The Open Group</a>, which recently established a franchise in China with <a href="http://kingdee.com/en/index.jsp">Kingdee</a>, is a vendor-neutral and technology-neutral consortium, which drives the creation of Boundaryless Information Flowâ„¢ that will enable access to integrated information within and between enterprises based on open standards and global interoperability.

</blockquote>
<p>That's Allen Brown, President and CEO of the Open Group, giving the opening talk.</p>
<p>I was there to speak about cloud computing, its challenges and opportunities to enterprise architects. Kingdee and TOG put on a great conference, which was well attended. Maybe I'll go back in October when they have their practitioners conference in Hong Kong.</p>

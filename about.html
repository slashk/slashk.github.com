<div class="about_head">
    <p>Ken used to work in <strong>ENTERPRISE COMPUTING</strong>, where they capitalized every word to make things seem important. While working there, he has titles like Principal Engineer, Technical Director and Chief Technologist, lived (or felt like he lived) in places like Saudi Arabia, India, Japan, Australia and Korea and worked in organizations called Asia Pacific Professional Services, Systems Line of Business and Edge Computing practice.</p>
      
    <p>All of this seems very long ago to Ken.</p>
    
    <p>What doesn't seem as long ago is his finishing #4 in the USA Cycling XC race.</p>

    <p>In addition to his internal activities, Ken is a frequent author and speaker. His first book, written with David Hornby, "Consolidation In the Data Center: Simplifying IT Environments To Reduce Total Cost of Ownership" was published in 2002. His latest book, "Migrating to the Solaris Operating System: The Discipline of UNIX-to-UNIX Migrations", was released in late 2003. He has spoken at many conferences and industry events including Gartner's Data Centre Summit, TOGAF China, IDC's Asia/Pacific Cloud Computing Conference and JavaOne.</p>

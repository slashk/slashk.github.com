title: MTBcalendar Dashboard Widget
---

This is a small Mac OS X Dashboard widget which lets you see regional mountain bike race calendars from the MTBcalendar website. I wrote it mostly so that I could always have the race schedule at my fingertips, although it also served as a good exercise in testing the (undocumented) [mtbcalendar.com](/projects/mtbcalendar) API.

It is written entirely in javascript with [Apple's Dashcode tool](http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/AppleApplications/Conceptual/Dashcode_UserGuide/Contents/Resources/en.lproj/Introduction/Introduction.html), along with a heap of [jQuery](http://jquery.com/ "jQuery").

This widget is hosted at  [http://slashk.github.com/mtb-calendar-widget/](http://slashk.github.com/mtb-calendar-widget/). There you can download the widget, learn how it works and reviews it's source code.
